"""bounded_run's spawn-to-track window: an interrupt there must not orphan the new child.

Every child starts in a session of its own, so a stop signal sent to the caller reaches none of
them; the caller's handler reaches them only through ``kill_live_trees``, which kills the
children the registry holds. A child is registered on the line right after ``Popen`` returns.
An interrupt raised before that registration completes finds the child untracked, so
``bounded_run`` itself must kill it before the interrupt propagates (``bounded_run.md``,
property 8).

The window is provoked deterministically, never by timing, at two points where CPython can run
a signal handler once ``Popen`` has returned. One is the registering call itself: the registry's
``track`` is patched to raise ``KeyboardInterrupt``, which is what a handler does when it runs at
that call's entry. The other is the first trace event after ``Popen.__init__`` returns, under a
Python-level tracer of the kind a debugger or a pure-Python coverage tracer installs: the tracer
is Python code, so the interpreter checks for a pending signal inside it, and the interrupt the
handler raises there propagates out of whichever frame was being traced. A frame that returns
the ``Popen`` object to its caller emits such an event before the object is registered. The
live tests then prove by pid, with a bounded wait, that no child survives. The unit test pins
the arm where ``Popen`` itself is interrupted and so returned nothing to kill.

Once registered, the child is reachable through ``kill_live_trees``, and what remains is that its
pid is forgotten however the run ends. An interrupt raised at the drain's frame entry -- a point
CPython checks for a pending signal with no tracer installed -- or at the first trace event after
the registration, must still leave the registry empty.
