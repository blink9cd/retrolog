"""Test fixture: spawn a grandchild that inherits our pipes, then outlive every test's bound.

This is the shape that defeats a bare ``subprocess.run(timeout=...)``: the grandchild inherits
the captured stdout/stderr handles, so killing only the direct child leaves them open and the
parent's post-timeout read blocks forever. The live timeout tests here drive it.

When the environment names two pid files, it records its own pid in the first -- before the
grandchild exists -- and the grandchild's in the second. Neither process exits before
``_LIFETIME_SECONDS``, an hour, so a test that cannot see both gone needs the pids to kill a
survivor itself; ``live_pid_guard`` sets the variables and does that cleanup. With neither set, as ``README.md`` runs it, it records
nothing.

The environment and not argv, because a tool under test may launch this fixture AS its own
subprocess and append flags of its own. Positional pid files would take those flags for paths:
the fixture would write its pid into a file named ``--path`` beside the caller, then crash
writing to the directory after it -- so the wedged child such a test models would already have
exited while the test passed.

# The handle is bound only to read its pid, which RL002 does not count as managing the process,
# so the finding stands; the reason is kept short so that line still fits the formatter's width.
#: Bound to a name so the Popen call plus its suppression fit inside the formatter's line width.
