"""The kernel32 layouts and signatures ``bounded_run``'s Windows job containment marshals.

Private to ``bounded_run``: it lives in that folder's ``src/``, and nothing outside that
folder imports it. Its name carries the tool's prefix, so it cannot shadow another tool's
module on ``sys.path``.

Why these sit apart
-------------------
These are transcriptions of the Win32 headers --
structure layouts and the function table -- with no behavior of their own; the job API that
calls through them, and the containment that drives it, stay in ``bounded_run.py`` beside the
spawn they are part of. ``bounded_run`` re-exports each name, so its tests read them where they
always have.

Entry point assumptions
-----------------------
Imported by ``bounded_run`` alone. Standard library only, and importable on every host: nothing
here loads a library.
