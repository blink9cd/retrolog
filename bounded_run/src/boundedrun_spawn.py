"""Start a ``bounded_run`` child and register it at once, so no stop can orphan it.

Private to ``bounded_run``: it lives in that folder's ``src/``, and nothing outside that
folder imports it. Its name carries the tool's prefix, so it cannot shadow another tool's
module on ``sys.path``.

Why the spawn is its own module
-------------------------------
The spawn is a seam of its own: which
streams the child gets, how it is detached from the caller's session, and which flags it
starts with. ``bounded_run`` still computes those flags (``spawn_creationflags``) and passes
them in, so its tests can substitute them where they always have.

The spawn-to-track window
-------------------------
A child leads a session of its own, so a stop signal sent to the caller never reaches it; the
caller's handler reaches it only through ``kill_live_trees``, which kills the children the
registry holds. :func:`run_text` and :func:`run_bytes` therefore call ``Popen`` and register the
pid in one frame, on consecutive statements, with nothing between: no frame hands the object
back to a caller first, so no frame return -- where a debugger's or a pure-Python coverage
tracer's code runs, and with it a pending signal's handler -- falls between them. A
``KeyboardInterrupt`` raised before the registration completes -- the stop such a handler
raises, landing on the call that registers -- finds the child unreachable through the registry,
so this module kills its tree and reaps it before re-raising. Should *kill_tree_fn* itself
raise there, its exception replaces the interrupt, which it keeps as ``__context__``, exactly
as on the drain's interrupt path.

Before this module, ``Popen`` returned to the run function, which called the drain helper,
which called the containment helper, and only then was the pid registered: two frame entries
between ``Popen`` and the registration. A frame entry is a point where stock CPython checks for
a pending signal, with or without a tracer, so a stop landing on either found the child
untracked and left it running. The one-frame shape removes both, and with them the frame
returns a Python-level tracer or profiler would add. The residual at ``Popen``'s own call
completion, below, is unchanged.

Once registered, the child is forgotten by a ``finally`` in that same frame, around both the
registration and the drain, so no frame entry -- the drain's own included, a point CPython does
check with no tracer at all -- falls between the registration and the guard that forgets. The
interrupt guard spans the drain as well, so an interrupt after the registration but before the
drain's own interrupt path is in force kills and reaps the child too, and a caller that never
calls ``kill_live_trees`` orphans nothing. An interrupt the drain's own path already acted on
is not acted on again: that path marks it handled once its kill and bounded reap have run, so
the kill happens once and the bound stays one grace period, even when the reap expired. A child
already reaped is not signaled again either: its pid may have been reused.

What stays out of reach is an interrupt delivered inside ``Popen``'s own call, before that call
hands the object back: in ``Popen``'s code after the child has started, at the pending-signal
check the interpreter makes as the call instruction completes, or in a hook run per instruction.
No object reaches this frame, so nothing here can name the child, and it is LEFT RUNNING in its
own session; CPython at most reaps it after it exits on its own (``bounded_run.md``, property 8).

Entry point assumptions
-----------------------
Imported by ``bounded_run`` alone, with this ``src/`` already on ``sys.path``. Standard library
and this ``src/``'s siblings only; the text-mode stream policy arrives as arguments, from
``stdio_utf8``.
