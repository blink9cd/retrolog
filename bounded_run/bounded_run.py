"""Bound a captured subprocess so a surviving grandchild cannot outlive the timeout.

Why this exists
---------------
``subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True, timeout=N)`` looks like a bound on the whole call.
It is not. On ``TimeoutExpired`` CPython kills only the DIRECT child, then goes back to reading
the captured pipes to assemble the exception's ``output`` -- and any surviving *grandchild* that
inherited those handles keeps them open, so that read blocks indefinitely. The bound is reliable
for a leaf child and unreliable for exactly the nested case the bound exists to catch, which is
the shape every orchestrator that runs other tools has.

This module inverts the order: on expiry it kills the whole process TREE first, and only then
touches the streams. Measured on Windows: the unfixed path did not return within 5 minutes
against a 3.0s bound; this path, then killing through ``taskkill /T``, returned in 3.97s.

On Windows the tree is a job object the child joins while still suspended. A nested run's job
nests inside it, so the kill reaches every descendant whether or not the child is alive. On
POSIX the child leads a process group, but a descendant that itself runs ``run_bounded`` leads a
NEW session, beyond that group's reach, so the kill freezes every group reachable from the
child's through the process table, then kills them all (``src/boundedrun_posix_tree.py``). Only
a descendant whose own parent exited before the kill, and which left that parent's group, is
out of the POSIX walk's reach. ``bounded_run.md`` records why, and what has been run where.

Entry point assumptions
-----------------------
``run_bounded`` is a drop-in for a capturing ``subprocess.run`` -- it bakes in ``capture_output``,
``encoding``/``errors`` (the policy ``stdio_utf8`` defines) and ``check=False``, returns a
``CompletedProcess``, and raises ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` carrying partial output. Every
existing ``except subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` handler therefore keeps working unchanged.

This module is a library: it has no CLI, and each tool imports it after putting this folder on
``sys.path`` from its own location, as ``bounded_run.md`` documents.
