"""Every environment variable this project reads by name is declared in its config.

``RETROLOG_RESOLVE_OFFLINE`` skips the live boundary tests and ``RETROLOG_TMDB_TOKEN``
skips the TMDb one when absent, so each changes which tests run without changing one
file. ``[tool.gate_cache] env`` in the project's pyproject.toml lists every variable the
tools read, so a cache of test results keyed on the environment never replays a stale
verdict: a variable missing from it would let a verdict recorded with it unset be
replayed into a run with it set, and the reverse.

So this test fails on a read nothing declares, or one whose name it cannot resolve, and
on a declaration nothing reads, which stops a renamed variable leaving a stale name
behind. It sits under retrolog_resolve, the only tool that reads the environment, but
scans every tool of the project.
