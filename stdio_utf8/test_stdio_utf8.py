"""Tests for stdio_utf8, the UTF-8 stream policy this project's tools apply.

This file holds no tests of its own beyond its guards: it is the one entry point for the
grouped suites in the sibling ``tests/`` directory, which is the only way they run. A
runner that launches each folder's top-level ``test_*.py`` reaches ``tests/`` through
the ``load_tests`` hook below, and through nothing else.

- ``tests/test_streams.py`` -- forcing a tool's own streams to UTF-8: stdout strict,
  stderr escaping, and the constants that decode a child's capture.
- ``tests/test_escaping.py`` -- the escaping boundary for a message quoting argv or a
  file name: ``printable``, ``print_escaped`` and ``EscapingArgumentParser``.
- ``tests/test_spell_unsafe.py`` -- ``spell_unsafe``, which makes visible a character a
  terminal would act on.
- ``tests/test_bootstrap.py`` -- the import ``stdio_utf8.md`` documents, run in a real
  child, which takes this folder's copy after the standard library.

Entry point assumptions: run bare, from any directory; the insert below puts this folder
on ``sys.path`` explicitly rather than inheriting it.
