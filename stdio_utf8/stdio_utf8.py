"""Force UTF-8 on a tool's streams, name the capture policy, and escape its messages.

Why this exists
---------------
Python derives a text stream's encoding from the locale whenever that stream is not a
terminal. On Windows that is the legacy ANSI code page (cp1252 on a Western install),
which cannot encode most non-ASCII characters. A tool that prints a path it discovered
on disk therefore works when run by hand in a UTF-8 terminal and raises
``UnicodeEncodeError`` the moment stdout is a pipe -- which is every scheduled run, every
CI run, and every run whose parent captures it.

The same locale default governs the other direction. ``subprocess.run(..., text=True)``
with no explicit ``encoding`` decodes the child using the locale code page, so a child
emitting UTF-8 decodes to mojibake -- or, for a byte undefined in cp1252 (0x81, 0x8D,
0x8F, 0x90, 0x9D), raises ``UnicodeDecodeError`` on subprocess's reader thread, where it
is swallowed: ``run()`` returns ``stdout=None`` and the caller fails later with a
confusing ``TypeError``.

The two halves must be fixed together in any tool that captures a child and reprints it.
A cp1252 decode followed by a cp1252 encode restores the original bytes by accident, so
forcing only the output stream to UTF-8 turns a working accident into double-encoded
corruption.

A strict stream brings a third hazard with it. Python decodes argv and file names with
``surrogateescape``, so a byte that is not UTF-8 arrives as a lone surrogate, which a
strict stream refuses: a refusal quoting a mistyped argument becomes a traceback. So the
two streams are forced differently. stderr keeps the ``backslashreplace`` Python opened
it with, and every diagnostic on it -- argparse's errors included -- prints the escape.
stdout stays strict, so a tool's data still fails loudly, and a MESSAGE that reaches
stdout is escaped at one boundary instead: ``print_escaped`` for a tool's own lines, and
``EscapingArgumentParser`` for argparse's help and ``--version``.

Entry point assumptions
-----------------------
``force_utf8_streams`` is called once, early in a tool's ``main()``, before anything is
printed. It deliberately does nothing for a stream a test has replaced with
``io.StringIO`` (no ``reconfigure`` method) or for a closed stream, so adopting it can
never destabilize an existing test harness.

This module is a library: it has no CLI, and each tool imports it after putting this
folder on ``sys.path`` from the project root, as ``stdio_utf8.md`` documents.
