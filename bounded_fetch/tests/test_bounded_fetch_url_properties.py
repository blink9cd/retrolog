"""Grouped suite: `https_url_or_none`'s security contract over arbitrary input.

`https_url_or_none` carries the `# fuzz-target` marker, and
`test_fuzz_https_url_or_none` is the property that satisfies it. Anything the rule
accepts is what a record may carry and what a request may be built from, so the
property holds every accepted string to the whole contract (https with a host,
no userinfo, no space, control or format character) over arbitrary text and over
URL-shaped strings built from schemes, userinfo, hosts, slashes and backslashes.
The rule never raises: a string it cannot parse is "no URL".
