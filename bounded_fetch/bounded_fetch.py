"""A hardened HTTPS GET and HEAD, bounded in what they may open, send, and read back.

The HEAD reports a redirect instead of following it.

One rule for which URLs may be requested at all (`https_url_or_none`), one place a
request is built (`build_request`, which refuses everything that rule refuses and any
header that would break the request's framing), and one bounded body read
(`read_body`, capped in size and in time). `fetch_url` chains the three around an
opener from `build_opener`, whose redirect handler follows only https and keeps the
caller's headers in their origin; it is the ONE network seam, which every unit test
leaves alone; the pieces either side of it are tested on their own. `head_url` is
the second seam: a HEAD through an opener from `build_no_follow_opener`, whose
redirect handler follows nothing, with `answer_head` turning what comes back into a
`HeadAnswer`.

A pure library: no CLI, no `__main__`, standard library only. Each caller decides its
own headers (a User-Agent a vendor requires, a bearer token) and its own timeout; this
module decides only what is safe to send and how much may come back.

    """`url` when it is an https URL with a host, else None.

    The one rule for a URL a record may carry or a request may be built from. A
    caller applies it wherever it decides a URL (so a rejected one becomes "no URL"
    in its own terms), and `build_request` applies it again at the sink, so none can
    reach the opener by any route.

    Admitted: an https URL with a non-empty host, no userinfo, and no whitespace or
    Unicode control or format character. Refused: every other scheme, a
    scheme-relative `//host/x`, an empty host, a `user:password@` prefix, and a
    string `urlsplit` itself refuses (an unclosed IPv6 bracket), which comes back as
    "no URL" rather than as a `ValueError` out of a parser. There is deliberately NO
    allowlist of hosts: the rule is about what a page can safely be handed and what
    this module may open, not about which CDN a vendor is using this year.

    The character scan runs on the RAW string and comes BEFORE the parse, because
    parsing is not filtering: `urlsplit` silently strips tab, carriage return and
    line feed, so a URL smuggling a header break parses clean, and it never looks at
    a NUL, an escape or a zero-width mark at all. It scans the characters that are
    actually there, so a percent-ESCAPED space or control character is ordinary URL
    text and survives. An earlier, weaker check let all of the above through.

    urllib's opener speaks `file:`, `ftp:` and `data:` as readily as https, and none of
    those passes here, so none is ever opened. An https request to an internal
    address fails at the TLS handshake, on certificate verification, before any
    request line is sent: no public authority issues a certificate for a private
    address. That holds for the FIRST hop only: redirects are followed, and where
    they go is the server's to say (an accepted risk), so it
    is not a guarantee that nothing internal is ever reached.

    Accepted verbatim, uppercase scheme included: urllib lowercases the scheme
    itself when it picks a handler.
