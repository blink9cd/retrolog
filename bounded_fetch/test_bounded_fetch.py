"""Aggregator for bounded_fetch's grouped suites: bare-runnable, 100% branch.

This file holds no tests of its own beyond its guards. The real suites live in the sibling
``tests/`` directory, one per concern: the URL rule and the request built from it, the URL
rule's property test, the redirect policy, the bounded body read, and the HEAD that
follows no redirect. The layout pairs ``tests/``
with this ``test_<folder>.py`` aggregator, whose ``load_tests`` pulls in every suite there.

Entry point assumptions: run bare, or under a coverage runner started from this folder. Both
put this directory on ``sys.path``; the insert below makes that explicit rather than
inherited, so the aggregator also works from another directory.

# "no tests ran" and "every test passed" are the same exit code, and nothing else in the
# run distinguishes them. One combined floor decays by growth, though. Once the suite
# exceeds it by more than the smallest file holds, that file can be lost whole while the
# total still clears the floor, and the guard goes on passing while gating nothing. A
# per-file floor closes that by construction, and the key-set comparison below means a file
# added later arrives unfloored LOUDLY instead of being absorbed into a combined number.

# itself and pass for an empty suite, which is the defect this guard exists to catch.
